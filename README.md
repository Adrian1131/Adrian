# About Me (Currently Working On)

My name is Adrian, and I am a Computer Science major at Southern Connecticut State University. I enjoy coding projects in my free time, and learning things related to software engineering. As a gain more experience, do more projects, and apply my skills, I want to eventually go into back-end development focusing on building and maintaining server-side logic, databases, and API's. 

# Technologies I have Used

I have used a few different languages, I primarily like to use Python, mainly because I am currently studying data structures and algorithms. I have experience using Java, Lua, C/C++, and many other tools which are on my personal resume. 

# Projects 

A project I really liked that I have done so far was making a Neo Vim configuration from scratch, it taught me many skills that apply to back-end development that I would like to do more of. I am currently working on building a portfolio website to use as a tool for my resume and building experience in any way I can.
